# Machine Learning (MATLAB) - Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems

Machine Learning course from Stanford University on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/9).

### Introduction
We will implement the anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network. In the second part, we will use collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.

### Environment
- macOS Catalina (version 10.15.3)
- MATLAB 2018 b

### Dataset
- ex8data1.mat
- ex8data2.mat
- ex8_movies.mat

- ex8_cofi.m - Octave/MATLAB script for second part of exercise 
- ex8data1.mat - First example Dataset for anomaly detection 
- ex8data2.mat - Second example Dataset for anomaly detection
- ex8_movies.mat - Movie Review Dataset
